## Project Structure and Installation

This project is built with Flutter and adheres to a common structure for organization and maintainability.

### File Organization

* **lib:** This directory contains all the source code for your Flutter application.
    * **firebase_options.dart** (Optional): Stores Firebase configuration details (**keep this file private**).
    * **main.dart:** The entry point of the application.
    * **models** (Optional): Dart classes representing data models used in the app.
    * **screens:** Contains all the UI screens of the application (e.g., login_screen.dart, home_page.dart).
    * **services** (Optional): Houses classes for handling business logic and interacting with external services.
    * **widgets:** Reusable UI components used throughout the app.
    * **widget_tree.dart** (Optional): Can be used to define the overall widget hierarchy of your app.

**Note:** The `models`, `services`, and `widget_tree.dart` files are optional and can be added as your project grows in complexity.
